A map of the sky that uses an [azimuthal equidistant projection](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Geo-Projections#azimuthalEquidistant) with star data. Longitudes and latitudes for the geo projection are obtained from [declination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination) and [right ascension](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension) respectively (longitude is also inverted, because, unlike the earth globe, the celestial sphere is seen from the inside).

The boreal (northern) sky is shown at left, while the austral (southern) at right. Because right ascension is given in hours, both maps are divided in 24 slices. A circle is shown every 10 degrees of declination.

Star size indicates [magnitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)). Bigger circles depict brighter stars.
